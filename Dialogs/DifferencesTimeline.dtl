assistant: Evidence suggests that you already kinda know what you're doing when you go on a pokemon adventure. However, my keen intuition has picked up a few differences from what you've experienced before.
assistant: First, your buddy will automatically fight any wild pokemon you encounter. They won't just sit idly until you catch them. So make sure you train your buddy to be as strong as possible.
assistant: Second, there are no stops that randomly hand out items. We don't need items at all in our world! After a battle, your pokemon are automatically healed to full, and you can have a pokeball delivered for 10 coins automatically when you defeat a pokemon in battle.
assistant: You can also disable that auto-buy-and-catch with the checkbox if you'd prefer to save money or not collect a bazillion critters at the time. You'll still get XP, stardust, and candy like you caught them. 
assistant: Third, you'll find a much larger variety of pokemon as you explore the world. From here, it looks like entirely different pokemon families live as close as a city block away from each other. There are also weekly global migration events, where you'll find some pokemon everywhere.
assistant: Finally, you don't have specific places treated as gyms. You can fight a raid boss in every 8-digit location code you go to. You can win each one once a day, and which ones are present changes weekly.
